# ITP449_K-meansClustering

#### Analyze the wineQualityReds dataset and group the wines into several clusters

##### 1. Normalize all columns of the DataFrame. Use StandardScaler.

##### 2. Create a range of k values from 1:11 for KMeans clustering. Iterate on the k values and store the inertia_ for each clustering in a list.

##### 3. Plot the chart of inertia vs number of clusters k.

##### 4. Pick K (number of clusters) for KMeans?

##### 5. Now cluster the wines into that same number of K clusters. Use random_state = 2021 when instantiate the KMeans model. Assign the respective cluster number to each wine.

##### 6. Print a crosstab (from Pandas) of cluster number vs quality.

##### 7. Investigate whether the clusters represent the quality of wine.
